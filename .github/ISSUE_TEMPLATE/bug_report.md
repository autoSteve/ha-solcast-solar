### Help us help you.

#### Do not create issues for questions on how to use or set up this integration.

Use the discussions for general support.  Only create issues to report geniune suspected bugs in the integration.

#### This issue template requests debug logs.  Please provide them.

Please don't provide just screenshots of logs (they're hard to read), or say "_logs look clean_" or assume they're not needed.  This integration works extremely well except when it fails, and when it fails, unless debug logs are provided - as ` ```back-ticked text``` `, or attachments - our chances of working out why it has failed are close to zero.

Note the instructions for getting debug logs, and follow them.

If you fail  to provide debug logs, you're providing us with permission to ignore you, or, at best, for us to say **_debug logs required_**, and then ignore you until you provide debug logs.

By being lazy and not bothering to fill in **all** of the data requested for an issue (such as the version of the integration you're running, or the type of home assistant installation you're running), you're encouraging us to be lazy and not bother responding.

#### Fill in **all** of the data requested.

Feel free to delete everything above this line.

## Logs

I confirm:

- [ ] I have attached **debug** logs
- [ ] I have embedded **debug** logs in the issue description (enclosed in tick marks ``` for proper formatting)
- [ ] Confirmed **debug** logs are not required for this issue

Make sure you include logs from HA listing the output from the Solcast integration showing the error - this is particularly useful in debugging issues and helping to determine whether the issue is with the integration or the Solcast service

To add detailed debug information, add the following to your configuration.yaml and restart HA:

``` yaml
logger:
  default: warn
  logs:
    custom_components.solcast_solar: debug
```

To inspect and collect debug logs examine `/config/home-assistant.log` using File Editor or Visual Studio Code Server.

If you are using docker, it sometimes can be easier to gather logs using `docker compose logs -n 500 -f homeassistant` or similar
